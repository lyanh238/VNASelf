## Examples

### Complete Health Consultation

```
User: I've been having headaches for the past week, usually in the afternoon. They're not severe but persistent.

Assistant: I understand you've been experiencing persistent afternoon headaches for a week. Let me help you with this.

**Questions to better understand your situation:**
1. Do the headaches occur at the same time each day?
2. Are they associated with any triggers (stress, screen time, hunger)?
3. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or stress levels recently?

**General recommendations for persistent headaches:**
- Maintain regular sleep schedule
- Stay hydrated throughout the day
- Take breaks from screens every hour
- Consider stress management techniques

**When to seek medical attention:**
- If headaches worsen or change pattern
- If you experience vision changes or nausea
- If headaches interfere with daily activities

Would you like me to help you schedule a doctor appointment to discuss these headaches?
```

### Complete Calendar Management

```
User: I need to schedule a series of follow-up appointments for my treatment.

Assistant: I'd be happy to help you schedule your follow-up appointments. Let me first check your current schedule to find available times.

**Current upcoming appointments:**
- October 22: 10:00 AM - Initial Consultation
- October 25: 2:00 PM - Lab Work

**Questions to help schedule your follow-ups:**
1. How many follow-up appointments do you need?
2. What's the recommended interval between appointments?
3. Do you have any time preferences (morning, afternoon, specific days)?
4. How long should each appointment be?

**Suggested scheduling approach:**
- Week 1: First follow-up (1 week after initial)
- Week 2: Second follow-up (2 weeks after initial)
- Month 1: Monthly check-in
- Month 3: 3-month review

Would you like me to create these appointments based on your initial consultation date?
```

### Mixed Health and Calendar Query

```
User: I have a doctor appointment tomorrow, but I'm feeling worse today. Should I go or reschedule?

Assistant: I understand you're feeling worse today and have a doctor appointment tomorrow. Let me help you decide.

**Health Assessment:**
Since you're feeling worse, it's important to consider:
- Are your symptoms getting significantly worse?
- Do you have any emergency symptoms (severe pain, difficulty breathing, high fever)?
- Can you wait until tomorrow, or do you need immediate attention?

**Appointment Options:**
1. **Keep tomorrow's appointment** if symptoms are manageable
2. **Reschedule to today** if you need earlier attention
3. **Seek immediate care** if symptoms are severe

**Current appointment details:**
- Date: Tomorrow at 2:00 PM
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Doctor: Dr. Smith

Would you like me to:
1. Help you find an earlier appointment today?
2. Keep your current appointment?
3. Help you identify if you need immediate medical attention?

What are your current symptoms, and how do they compare to when you scheduled the appointment?
```
